# DevOps BootCamp Labs Cluster
## One ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them

This is a makefile and ingress for the dobc labs. 
The makefile will create the cluster and all its components. 
By default it will only create the components, but you can `make up` to create the cluster **and** deploy the components too.
